webmenu was a service that scrapped lunch menus 
of restaurants in Hradec Kralove that offered meal 
delivery. The website was running on Google App Engine.

Scrapping of menus turned out to be a unsustainable model
and so I decided to shut the site down.

There is already a better alternative: http://www.lunchtime.cz/
